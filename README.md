## ✨ Overview

**Notion → WordPress Sync** bridges your Notion workspace and your WordPress site.

It fetches structured content (pages, databases, and blocks) from Notion and translates them into **native Gutenberg blocks** and creates blog posts, giving you the best of both worlds:
- The collaborative content creation of **Notion**.
- The publishing power and SEO ecosystem of **WordPress**.

Perfect for content teams who draft in Notion but publish in WordPress.
